You will be provided with two versions of source codes from one model and the respective documentation document. Your tasks are as follows:

1. Extract the code from both documents and automatically identify the programming language(s) used.
2. Provide a well-structured summary in natural language (do not use unnecessary bullet points) that explains the purpose, functionality, and structure of the code. This summary should read as a clear technical report that could be shared with stakeholders. Describe 1.) The overall goal or functionality of the program/module 2.)The key components or processing steps, including any algorithms or significant logic blocks 3.)The inputs and expected outputs, including data types and formats 4.) Any assumptions or prerequisites for running the code 5.) Dependencies such as external libraries, APIs, environment variables, configuration files, external functions or specific runtime environments.
3. Perform a unified diff between the two versions of the code for each pair of files to identify and analyze all modifications. Begin by reporting the total number of lines that have changed, clearly distinguishing between added, removed, and modified lines. For each change, provide a concise description that includes the nature of the modification, its classification (such as feature addition, refactor, bug fix, or breaking change), and an assessment of its associated risk level (low, medium, or high). This information should be presented in a way that preserves the context of the change and supports an informed review. If the total number of changes is relatively small (fifteen or fewer), the report should include individual explanations for each change. Each explanation should be concise but informative, offering just enough context to understand what was changed and the impact on the code, without becoming overly verbose. Describe the code changes using this format: Mention the line number. Briefly describe what was added, modified, or removed. Include the type of change in parentheses (e.g., feature addition, refactor, bug fix, etc.). Add a risk assessment (e.g., low risk, medium risk). In cases where there are many changes, the report should still highlight the most critical or high-impact modifications individually - typically the top three to five - while summarizing the remainder in aggregated form. This ensures that significant updates or potential risks are not buried within a large set of minor edits. The final output should be a structured, flowing narrative that balances coverage with clarity. It should read as a formal analysis suitable for technical documentation or change control, without relying on bullet points or fragmented lists. Always make sure to reference the line number of the code when discussing changes.
4. Review the code and flag any items that may require governance or compliance oversight, including, but not limited to, threshold values or magic numbers, seed values or randomization parameters, feature flags or toggles, and any date/time window constraints or related logic.
5. Suggest test cases by providing three happy-path scenarios covering normal expected behavior and four edge-case scenarios addressing boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and error handling.
