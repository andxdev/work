I demonstrated problem-solving and innovation in the work I did for the tracked observation task in the Insurance Framework Review. Instead of relying on the model inputs, I imported the asset-level data of different insurers from Capital IQ and obtained the respective SAP, Moody’s and Fitch ratings to derive the rating inputs according to the methodology indicated by the criteria. I used SQL to derive private ratings and recreated the methodology directly from the criteria in Python to streamline the process for multiple credits. This demonstrated critical thinking, as I did not rely on the inputs provided by insurers but independently derived and validated them. This also uncovered an important gap in the analyst’s implementation, which was subsequently escalated and converted into a formal Finding.
