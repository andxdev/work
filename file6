Next year I aim to continue broadening both my technical and analytical capabilities, and to take on work with greater scope and complexity. I would like to deepen my involvement in projects that combine model validation with quantitative research, data science and automation, building on the initiatives delivered this year. As I progress through my MSc in Statistics, I plan to apply more advanced modelling and statistical methods to validation activities, particularly in areas such as stress testing, calibration research, and benchmarking analysis.
I would also like to expand my exposure to new asset classes and criteria frameworks, with a particular focus on Structured Finance, to strengthen versatility and contribute more broadly across the model suite. In addition, I am interested in contributing to research-oriented workstreams—such as methodology enhancements, exploratory analysis and analytical tool development—as these areas align closely with my academic background and long-term career direction.
To achieve these goals, I would benefit from continued access to complex validation assignments, opportunities to collaborate more closely with the Global Analytics and Methodology (GAM) team, and increased exposure to senior reviewers’ decision-making and feedback. My overall focus next year is on deepening technical expertise, increasing contribution to analytical research, and continuing to expand the value I bring across the modelling lifecycle.
