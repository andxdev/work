This year I demonstrated a growth mindset by actively seeking feedback, embracing learning opportunities, and deliberately pushing my technical and analytical capabilities forward. I regularly incorporated comments from reviewers and analysts into my validation work, using them to refine my approach and strengthen the clarity and structure of reports. I have also become increasingly comfortable working in ambiguous, unstructured problem spaces—such as the Risk Filtering Tool project and several non-standard validation tasks—approaching them with curiosity and experimentation rather than relying on fixed templates.
My part-time MSc in Statistics at LSE reflects a long-term commitment to continuous learning and technical development. The knowledge gained in areas such as machine learning, optimisation and statistical modelling has already enhanced my work, particularly in data-driven research tasks and automation initiatives. Balancing this programme alongside a full workload has required resilience, planning and adaptability, especially when deadlines coincided.
I have also supported others by sharing knowledge and offering perspective on Python implementation, automation practices and analytical design choices. Across the year I have remained open to change, adapted quickly to new expectations and methodologies, and contributed positively to a collaborative team culture—all of which reflect a sustained growth mindset.
