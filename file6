This year I consistently applied critical thinking by clearly framing analytical and model-risk questions before proposing solutions. In several model validations (e.g., Sovereigns, RMBS, CLOs, Insurance and Global Covered Bonds) I began by decomposing each assignment into: (i) key modelling assumptions; (ii) data inputs and transformations; and (iii) performance and sensitivity behaviour. This structure allowed me to isolate where model weaknesses were most likely to arise, prioritise testing around those areas, and distinguish genuine model issues from expected behaviour driven by criteria or market conditions. For example, in the Sovereign and Spain Repline Generator validations, I used targeted backtesting and scenario analysis to reconcile discrepancies between observed performance and model outputs, leading to well-supported recommendations rather than superficial findings.
I demonstrated problem-solving and innovation in the tracked observation and stress-testing work for the CIR and FX models. Instead of relying on manual spreadsheet analysis, I designed and implemented Python scripts to ingest historical curves, calculate metrics, and generate diagnostic outputs that highlighted persistent deviations between stressed and non-stressed curves. This required making design decisions under ambiguity (e.g., which thresholds and time windows to use, how to handle data gaps) and iterating quickly based on feedback from senior reviewers. The resulting analysis enabled a more informed discussion at the Senior Forum and provided a scalable framework for future curve monitoring.
In the Risk Filtering Tool project, I addressed an open-ended problem: how to prioritise large volumes of corporate files for review using quantitative information. I approached this by first clarifying the business objective (identifying groups of issuers where incremental review is most informative), then translating it into a technical problem (clustering based on variables consistent with corporate criteria such as rating, sector and FRP). I evaluated alternative clustering specifications, assessed stability and interpretability, and refined the approach through discussions with Coverage Analytics. This work balanced experimentation with sound judgement, resulting in segmentation outputs that are both analytically robust and practically usable.
Across assignments, I have also shown urgency and decision-making discipline. I triaged issues according to materiality for ratings and timelines, escalated potential high-impact findings promptly, and distinguished between points that warranted formal recommendations and those better captured as observations or documentation clarifications. This approach has allowed me to resolve issues efficiently, maintain momentum on multiple parallel projects, and provide model validation that is not only technically rigorous but also responsive to evolving analytical and business needs.
