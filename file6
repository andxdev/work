Over the past year, I delivered a broad set of model validation, criteria analysis, tracked observation, and automation projects across multiple asset classes, each contributing directly to ratings quality, operational efficiency, and regulatory confidence. My work supported enterprise-wide goals by strengthening analytical integrity, reducing operational risk, and improving the speed and consistency of model-related decisions.
First, I completed a high volume of full model validation assignments across Sovereigns, Global Covered Bonds, RMBS, CLOs, Insurance, and Structured Finance. These validations provided independent assurance over methodology soundness, data inputs, and rating model performance, enabling rating analysts and committees to rely on accurate, well-governed models throughout the year. Several validations, such as the Ecuador Sovereign model review, the RMBS Deal Analyzer, and the Spain Repline Generator series, resulted in recommendations that improved model transparency, documentation, assumption governance, and process clarity. These outcomes supported stronger analytical decisions, alignment with updated criteria, and enhanced market confidence.
Second, I drove meaningful operational improvements through automation and analytical tooling. I built automated Python processes for the US Public Finance tracked observation task and for the CIR model stress curve analysis. These tools replaced manual steps, reduced operational error risk, and freed analyst time, enabling faster turnaround and greater focus on analytical judgement. I also contributed to a Word/PDF automation project using Spark and ExamDiff to streamline model documentation comparison. This initiative supports the wider organisational move toward AI and workflow optimisation and directly aligns with efficiency and productivity goals.
Third, I supported rating execution and analyst teams through criteria reviews, sensitivity analyses and change recommendations. For example, I analysed Foreign Exchange risk effects on Structured Finance stressed interest rates, assessed insurance capital methodology assumptions, and evaluated corporate clustering and IFR data behaviour. These pieces of work provided additional analytical insight to senior stakeholders, strengthened rating frameworks, and ensured our models reflect evolving economic and credit conditions.
Finally, beyond technical delivery, I contributed through consistency, reliability, and timeliness. All assigned tasks were completed on schedule, with strong communication and documentation standards, helping internal teams meet publication and committee deadlines while maintaining auditability and transparency across workstreams.
Collectively, these achievements demonstrate my ability to deliver measurable outcomes that improve ratings quality, strengthen model risk governance, and generate tangible value for both analytical and operational groups within the organisation.
