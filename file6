Throughout the year, I collaborated closely with analytical, criteria, model development and governance teams to deliver validations that directly supported rating delivery and compliance timelines across Sovereigns, Structured Finance, Insurance, RMBS, CLOs and Covered Bonds. This collaboration ensured accurate model outcomes, clearer documentation, and timely completion of all assigned validations, helping analytical teams meet committee and publication deadlines.
I worked jointly with Model Development and analytical colleagues on automation initiatives, including Python and Spark-based tools. These solutions reduced manual workload, improved reproducibility, and enabled more robust model and document comparison processes, creating operational efficiencies that benefit multiple analytical groups.
I also contributed to the Risk Filtering Tool project by integrating analytical criteria insights into data clustering methodology. This cross-functional work produced actionable segmentation results that support future prioritisation of review files and offer a scalable analytical framework for 2026.
Across these workstreams, I promoted transparency and alignment, helping advance shared goals, reduce process risk, and contribute to measurable operational and analytical improvements across the organisation.
